## Step 4 - Project level metadata

An NFT contract can also expose metadata at the collection level. Project level metadata can be found in the location `<base_uri>/metadata.json` where base_uri looks like `www.api.example.com` and the file `metadata.json` can be found in the root of that directory structure.

Zilkroad will use a project level image for your collection from ```description``` ```external_url``` and ```animation_url``` without needing you to ask Zilkroad to update this data.

```js
{
  "name": "Unique and Diverse Creatures",
  "description": "10,000 unique and diverse creatures living on the blockchain.",
  "external_url": "https://example.com/creature",
  "animation_url": "https://animation.example.com/creature"
}
```
