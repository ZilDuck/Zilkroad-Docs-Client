## Non-fungible Tokens

Non-fungible tokens are also known as ZRC-1's or ZRC-6's -  as these are the standards which defines the non-fungible token contracts.

ZRC-1 is an older legacy standard which is not supported to be traded on Zilkroad. ZRC-1s are able to be viewed on your wallet page, but they cannot be listed.

ZRC-6's are the newer standard of NFTs which provide similar functionality to ERC-1155 and ERC-721 such as defining royalty and metadata standards.

### How do I get my ZRC-6 tradable on Zilkroad?

Anyone can list any ZRC-6 contract to the Zilkroad. There is no permission required, if it exists in your wallet, you can trade it.

If you have recently deployed a contract and have minted yourself tokens then zilkroad should immediately see the new tokens.

If the ZRC-6 contract code is edited or modified it may become unusable with zilkroad, please ensure your contract does not have any standard warnings on viewblock.

### How do I get my ZRC-1 tradable on Zilkroad?

Project owners are recommended to migrate and upgrade to ZRC-6.
