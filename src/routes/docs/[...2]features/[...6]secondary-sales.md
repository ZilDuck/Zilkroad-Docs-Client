## Secondary sales

### What is a secondary sales?

The secondary market is the collection all the listings which occur post-mint-inception and is the most anticipated feature of Zilkroad.

If you have bought, traded or been airdropped ZRC-6's from ecosystem projects or have minted ZRC-6's directly to yourself from your own contract these are able to be sold on the secondary market!

### What fees are taken on secondary sales?

Zilkroad hopes to bootstrap the inital NFT liquidity and creativity required for Zilliqa to bloom as an NFT chain, as such, it is in our intrest to offer 0% fees for this inital bootstrapping phase.

Zilkroad has **zero** secondary listing fees.

Zilkroad takes **zero** royalty from your sale.

### When will fees be applied to the platform

Zilkroad will review fees in January 2022.
