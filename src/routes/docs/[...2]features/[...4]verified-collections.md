## Verification

A blue checkmark on a collection means that the collection and curator has been verified by Zilkroad.

### What does having a verified mean?

Blue checkmarks are added to collection pages if the public figure controlling the wallet is at risk of impersonation.

Verification does not mean that Zilkroad endorses these projects.

### How do I get a collection verified?

Our team actively reviews all high volume collections that are passed through the Zilkroad. That said, reaching a trading threshold alone does not ensure a collection will be automatically verified by our team.

To qualify for a collection verification review, you must have at least 2000 followers on Twitter, Instagram, Discord or Youtube for our team to review. That said, reaching a social following threshold alone does not ensure a collection will be automatically verified by our team.

A verified collection is performed at the contract level, meaning subsiquent releases of additional contracts are **not** verified collections.

If your collection meets the critera above for review, please contact hello@zilkroad.io with the subject line \[ZRC-6 verification\] and provide some details about you and your token.

There is a **setup fee** of 500 USD if your application is successful.
