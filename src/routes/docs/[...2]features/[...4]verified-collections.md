## Verification

A blue checkmark on a collection means that the collection and curator has been deemed non-malicious by the general community sentiment and Zilkroad.

### What does having a verified mean?

Blue checkmarks are added to collection pages if the public figure controlling the wallet is at risk of impersonation.

Verification does not mean that Zilkroad endorses these projects.

### How do I get a collection verified?

Our team actively reviews all high volume collections that are passed through the Zilkroad. That said, reaching a trading threshold alone does not ensure a collection will be automatically verified by our team.

A verified collection is performed at the contract level, meaning your subsequent releases of additional contracts are **not** verified collections.

### Verification Disclaimer

Zilkroad does not endorse, support or accepts any liability around the contract being purchased as an asset by individuals for the reason that Zilkroad has verified a contract. A contract maybe de-verified in the future if malicious activity is known as a fact to have occured.
