## Fungible Tokens

Fungible tokens are also known as ZRC-2's as this is the standard which defines this contract.

Sellers can choose from a list of pre-approved fungible tokens.

Buyers will need to purchase in the sellers preferred fungible token.

You can wrap native ZIL into tokenised WZIL and unwrap WZIL into ZIL via the wrapper interface.

### How do I get my ZRC-2 tradable on Zilkroad?

To qualify for a token review, you must have at least 1 million ZIL in liquidity and have a token trading age of 1 year. That said, reaching a liquidity threshold or age does not ensure a token will be accepted by our team.

Please contact hello@zilkroad.io with the subject line \[ZRC-2 approval\] and provide some details about you and your token. We will create advertising and marketing material around your launch.

There is a one time **setup fee** of 15,000 USD if your application is successful.
