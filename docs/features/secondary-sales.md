## Secondary sales

### What is a secondary sales?

The secondary market is the collection all the listings which occur post-mint-inception and is the most anticipated feature of Zilkroad.

If you have bought, traded or been airdropped ZRC-6's from ecosystem projects or have minted ZRC-6's directly to yourself from your own contract these are able to be sold on the secondary market!

### When will fees be applied to the platform

Zilkroad will review fees post platform launch.
