## Sellers guide

### Secondary sales

Sellers can sell ZRC-6 NFTs they have previously bought, traded, airdropped or deployed and minted to themselves on secondary markets for free!

Sellers can sign in to their profile to see what NFTs are currently in their wallet. Once an NFT has been identified which the seller wants to sell, they can press the ellipses to open the menu for that particular token which contains the option to sell.

Once selected, a modal will appear containing information for the seller to fill related to the sale including the token they wish to receive and how much. Extra information about the estimated royalty breakdown is shown including how much the seller will receive after royalty.

The seller submits two transactions. The first gives the marketplace the permission to move the NFT to escrow storage. The second places your sell order on-chain and moves the NFT to escrow.

Once the list button has been pressed the seller waits for the response to return in the browser. When the transaction completes a modal will show either a success or error message.

When the seller returns to their profile page they will see the NFT will be in the 'Listed NFTs' section.

The seller can return to their Zilkroad profile another time to check on the status of their current order. If the item isn't sold it will remain in the 'Listed NFTs' section, however if it is missing then a row in 'Account activity' should be shown detailing the sale.

### Primary sales

Sellers who wish to use primary sales as a method of initial mint offering should read the [Primary Sales / Launchpad](../features/primary-sales-launchpad.md) page.

## Buyers guide

### Secondary sales

Buyers can either look for a specific collection or browse the currently listed collections.

Once a collection has been found which the buyer wants to purchase. They can use the statistics of sales data and aggregated blockchain data to help make a decision about this collection and token. The price floor is also helpful in finding the cheapest token of a collection being listed.

The buyer decides they want to purchase this token for the listed price of 123 WZIL, which is the cheapest token available in this collection. Pressing the Buy button will open a modal containing more details about the transaction assuming the buyer is already logged in.

The buyer approves two transactions. The first gives the marketplace the permission to move a certain amount of tokens away from your wallet used to pay the seller. The second calls the marketplace to do the trade on your behalf.

Once the buy button has been pressed the buyer waits for the response to return in the browser. When the transaction completes a modal will show either a success or error message.

When the buyer returns to their profile page they will see the updated statistics for their account for the sale they made. The NFT you purchased will be in the 'Held NFTs' section.

### Primary sales

Buyers can browse all the current launchpad projects that are currently listing. Buyers can batch mint one or several tokens in one sale transaction.
